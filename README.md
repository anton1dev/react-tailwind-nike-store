# React + Vite Nike Shoes Store
This project is emulation of online-store sports shoes & clothes.

Generally, main idea of mine development today - take my time to practice with several technologies:
- ***React.js***, probably the best Front-End JS library;
- ***TailwindCSS***, powerful, but easy-to-learn and very popular CSS lib;
- ***Vercel***, a web-service which allows users to deploy applications in 2 min.

# What you can do here
At beautiful main page, you can choose a brand new sneakers pair.
You can also read a description for top-saled Nike shoes, compare them to each other, add goods to cart and so on.

# How to use
