# React + Vite Nike Shoes Store
This project is emulation of online-store for sports shoes & clothing.

The main goal of my development today is to practice with several technologies:
- ***React.js*** - probably the best Front-End JS library;
- ***TailwindCSS*** - a powerful, but easy-to-learn and very popular CSS lib;
- ***Vercel*** - a web service that allows users to deploy applications in 2 min.

# Features
On the beautiful main page, you can choose a brand new pair of sneakers.
You can also read descriptions of the top-saled Nike shoes, compare them to each other, add goods to cart and so much more.

# How to use
